    "text": "Details about the dataset\n\nThere are 8,103 series id’s and 13 variables\nThe seasonal and periodicity_code are categorical variables each containing two cases.\n\nThe seasonal variable equals “S” for seasonally adjusted and “U” for unadjusted. There are 325 seasonally adjusted series and 7,778 unadjusted series.\nThe periodicity code is “R” for monthly and “S” for semi-annual. There are 4,202 series with monthly data and 3,901 with semi-annual data.\n\nThe item codes are useful for selecting the same category of CPI across geographic region or city. For example, the item code “SAH” represents “housing”; by selecting all the rows with item code “SAH” we can select all the housing code CPI indexes.\nArea codes\n\nThere are 58 unique area codes\nThe area code “0000” is the U.S. city average\nIt is only the area code “0000” that has seasonally adjusted CPI indexes\nThe numerical area codes running from “0100” to “0490” represent the census regions https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf\nThe four largest regions are Northeast (“0100”), Midwest (“0200”), South (“0300”) and West (“0400”)\nCensus divisions within each region are represented by the first two digits of the region and an additional two digits for the division. For example, the Northeast is “0100” and Division 1, New England is “0110” and Division 2, Middle Atlantic is “0120”, etc.\nThe area codes of Class D urban areas (populations between 2,500 and 49,999) begin with the letter D.\nThe area codes of Class B/C urban areas (population less than 2.5 million) begin with the letter N.\nThe area codes of Class A urban areas (population more than 2.5 million) begin with the letter S.\n\nThe base period is the year and month that the index equals 100.\nThe begin and end period is a string beginning with the letter “M” for the month and two digits that represent the month of the year, e.g. “M04” denotes April. In some datasets, the variable “M13” is used to denote the average value for the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narea_code\narea_name\nCount\nSA\nNSA\nMonthly\nSemi-Annual\n\n\n\n\n0000\nU.S. city average\n1115\n325\n790\n725\n390\n\n\n0100\nNortheast\n156\n0\n156\n78\n78\n\n\n0110\nNew England\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\n0120\nMiddle Atlantic\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\n0200\nMidwest\n156\n0\n156\n78\n78\n\n\n0230\nEast North Central\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\n0240\nWest North Central\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\n0300\nSouth\n156\n0\n156\n78\n78\n\n\n0350\nSouth Atlantic\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\n0360\nEast South Central\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\n0370\nWest South Central\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\n0400\nWest\n156\n0\n156\n78\n78\n\n\n0480\nMountain\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\n0490\nPacific\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\nA104\nPittsburgh, PA\n96\n0\n96\n45\n51\n\n\nA210\nCleveland-Akron, OH\n102\n0\n102\n51\n51\n\n\nA212\nMilwaukee-Racine, WI\n95\n0\n95\n44\n51\n\n\nA213\nCincinnati-Hamilton, OH-KY-IN\n95\n0\n95\n44\n51\n\n\nA214\nKansas City, MO-KS\n95\n0\n95\n44\n51\n\n\nA311\nWashington-Baltimore, DC-MD-VA-WV\n100\n0\n100\n50\n50\n\n\nA421\nLos Angeles-Riverside-Orange County, CA\n102\n0\n102\n51\n51\n\n\nA425\nPortland-Salem, OR-WA\n95\n0\n95\n44\n51\n\n\nD000\nSize Class D\n140\n0\n140\n70\n70\n\n\nD200\nMidwest - Size Class D\n102\n0\n102\n51\n51\n\n\nD300\nSouth - Size Class D\n102\n0\n102\n51\n51\n\n\nN000\nSize Class B/C\n154\n0\n154\n77\n77\n\n\nN100\nNortheast - Size Class B/C\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\nN200\nMidwest - Size Class B/C\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\nN300\nSouth - Size Class B/C\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\nN400\nWest - Size Class B/C\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\nS000\nSize Class A\n156\n0\n156\n78\n78\n\n\nS100\nNortheast - Size Class A\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS11A\nBoston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\nS12A\nNew York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS12B\nPhiladelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS200\nMidwest - Size Class A\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS23A\nChicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS23B\nDetroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS24A\nMinneapolis-St.Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS24B\nSt. Louis, MO-IL\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS300\nSouth - Size Class A\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS35A\nWashington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS35B\nMiami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS35C\nAtlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS35D\nTampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS35E\nBaltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS37A\nDallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS37B\nHouston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS400\nWest - Size Class A\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS48A\nPhoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS48B\nDenver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS49A\nLos Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS49B\nSan Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS49C\nRiverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA\n122\n0\n122\n61\n61\n\n\nS49D\nSeattle-Tacoma-Bellevue WA\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS49E\nSan Diego-Carlsbad, CA\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS49F\nUrban Hawaii\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62\n\n\nS49G\nUrban Alaska\n124\n0\n124\n62\n62"

On July 10th I wrote a blog and used the “Environment, Histor, ..” pane to commit my changes to git hub, but I received the following error\n\n\n\nCommit Error\n\n\nI shelved the decision to commit and waited until Saturday morning to learn more about gpg. I found the github pages to set up the key etc. and then I turned to RStudio to figure out how to add the key. A google search lead me to the fact that RStudio is set up for ssh and not gpg. I then set up a new ssh key within RStudio using the Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN &gt; Create SSH Key steps.\n\n\n\nCreate ssh key\n\n\nWhat I also remembered is that when I watched a video on setting up quarto for blogging, commits were done via the terminal window. So what worked for me is the following two lines at the command line:\ngit commit -m “commit message”\ngit push origin main\nwhere you specify the relevant “commit message”.\nIt’s actually quite simple if you know what you are doing, and waste countless hours if you don’t."

    "text": "This blog recreates the blog post from yesterday, August 3, 2025, so that the contents of the table can be copied from the post.\nThe Relative Importance page of the BLS CPI website provides a spreadsheet of the weights of the components of the CPI index. These weights can be used to decompose aggregate indexes into changes of their components.\nThe most important decomposition of the CPI index is that of headline inflation into core inflation plus energy and food inflation.\nWhat other decompositions exist?\nFirst, by focusing on the “Special aggregate indexes” in table 1 of the Relative Importance spreadsheet we can construct the following groups of indexes that add up to the “All items” index. The easiest starting point is the group of indexes whose title begins with “All items less…”\n\nAll items less food\nAll items less shelter\nAll items less medical care\nAll items less energy\nAll items less food and energy\n\nBeside the above five indexes and the decomposition of Headline (all items) into core, we also have a breakdown of headline into commodities (goods) and services inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem and Group\nCPI-U\nCPI-W\nSeries Code\nSeries ID\n\n\n\n\nAll items less food\n86.309\n84.834\nSA0L1\nCUSR0000SA0L1\n\n\nFood\n13.691\n15.166\nSAF1\nCUSR0000SAF1\n\n\nAll items\n100.000\n100.000\nSA0\nCUSR0000SA0\n\n\nAll items less shelter\n64.517\n66.814\nSA0L2\nCUSR0000SA0L2\n\n\nShelter\n35.483\n33.186\nSAH1\nCUSR0000SAH1\n\n\nAll items\n100.000\n100.000\nSA0\nCUSR0000SA0\n\n\nAll items less medical care\n91.727\n93.054\nSA0L5\nCUSR0000SA0L5\n\n\nMedical care\n8.273\n6.946\nSAM\nCUSR0000SAM\n\n\nAll items\n100.000\n100.000\nSA0\nCUSR0000SA0\n\n\nAll items less energy\n93.784\n92.214\nSA0LE\nCUSR0000SA0LE\n\n\nEnergy\n6.216\n7.786\nSA0E\nCUSR0000SA0E\n\n\nAll items\n100.000\n100.000\nSA0\nCUSR0000SA0\n\n\nAll items less food and energy\n80.094\n77.048\nSA0L1E\nCUSR0000SA0L1E\n\n\nFood\n13.691\n15.166\nSAF1\nCUSR0000SAF1\n\n\nEnergy\n6.216\n7.786\nSA0E\nCUSR0000SA0E\n\n\nAll items\n100.001\n100.000\nSA0\nCUSR0000SA0\n\n\nCommodities\n36.201\n40.085\nSAC\nCUSR0000SAC\n\n\nServices\n63.799\n59.915\nSAS\nCUSR0000SAS\n\n\nAll items\n100.000\n100.000\nSA0\nCUSR0000SA0\n\n\nCommodities less food and energy commodities\n19.388\n20.750\nSACL1E\nCUSR0000SACL1E\n\n\nServices less energy services\n60.705\n56.298\nSASLE\nCUSR0000SASLE\n\n\nAll items less food and energy\n80.093\n77.048\nSA0L1E\nCUSR0000SA0L1E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, if we ignore the “Special aggregate indexes” and group all the “Indent Level” 1 indexes, we obtain the following set of sub-indexes that add up to 100:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndent Level\nitem\nCPI-U\nCPI-W\n\n\n\n\n1\nFood and beverages\n14.526\n15.959\n\n\n1\nHousing\n44.201\n41.932\n\n\n1\nApparel\n2.480\n2.751\n\n\n1\nTransportation\n16.571\n19.290\n\n\n1\nMedical care\n8.273\n6.946\n\n\n1\nRecreation\n5.292\n4.499\n\n\n1\nEducation and communication\n5.732\n5.534\n\n\n1\nOther goods and services\n2.925\n3.089\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n100.000\n100.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese eight indexes can be further decomposed into the key contributors.
