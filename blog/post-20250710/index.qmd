## Introduction  
 
The landing page for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is <https://www.bls.gov/cpi/>. To access the underlying data, select "Databases" within the drop down menu of the "CPI Data" tab to open <https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm> .  
 
I am interested in the "All Urban consumers (Current Series)", so I clicked on the **text** 
icon on the right-hand side which opens the directory <https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/> 

The ["cu.txt"](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.txt) file contains information on the structure of the CPI code. The CPI code consists of five elements:  

- survey abbreviation, e.g. "CU" represents urban consumers  
- [seasonal (code) ](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.seasonal), "S" denotes seasonally adjusted, "R" denotes seasonally unadjusted. These are summarized in the "cu.seasonal" text file.  
- [periodicity code](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.periodicity): "R" denotes monthly and "S" denotes semi-annual  
- [area_code](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.area): "0000" denotes "U.S. city average" and other codes are listed in "cu.area"text file.
- [item_code](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.item) : "SAO" denotes "All items" and other codes are listed in item "cu.item" text file.  

The file ["cu.series"](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.series) contains a taxonomy of all the CPI indexes that includes the five elements list above, the series title and additional information about the start- and end-date of the series,  

Before exploring more of the files in <https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/> we will review the [relative importance](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/) page to gain a better understanding of some of the key components of the CPI. One can access this page starting at <https://www.bls.gov/cpi/> and selecting "Tables" in the  "CPI Data" dropdown menu, and then clicking on the link under "Relative importance and weights".  

Download the xlsx file under the "Relative Importance" heading to obtain the weights of the sub-indexes within the "All items" index. The worksheet labelled "Table 1" contains the weights in the urban consumer CPI (CPI-U) and the clerical workers CPI (CPI-W). The first column lists the level of aggregation of the index that runs from level 1 (the most aggregated) to level 8 (the least aggregated). Of the 322 indexes, we will ignore the 27 indexes listed under "special aggregate indexes" and review the level 1 indexes that remain. The eight level 1 indexes and their weights are listed in the table below  

![Relative importance of Level 1 CPI indexes](CPI-level_1_rel_imp.png)  

The weights sum to 100 for both the CPI-U and CPI-W indexes.  

Returning to <https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/> you will notice that each of the level 1 indexes has a file that contains data. For example, "cu.11.USFoodBeverage" contains the time series data of all the indexes within the Food and beverage level 1 CPI index. The data is in the tidy format and includes the series id, year, period, value and footnote codes.  The period is defined in the [cu.period](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.period) text file.

## Adding descriptions to the CPI data

For the purposes of automating report creation, I tried to use the files available on the BLS website without much preprocessing outside of R. The tab-delimited cu.series.txt file is very useful, but I cannot load it without running into an error so I have created a csv version that works better. The three most useful variables are: series_id, area_code and series_title. I want to focus on the seasonally adjusted U.S. urban consumer price index so I need to select the series_id that begins with "CU",  select the area_code that equals 0 , and the seasonal code that equals "S".

#| eval: FALSE

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

path <- "G:\\My Drive\\Research\\Inflation\\"

dfs <- read.csv(paste0(path,"cu.series.csv"))

df <- dfs[grepl("CU",dfs$series_id),]

df <- df[df$area_code == "0",]

df <- df[df$seasonal == "S",]

df$short_name <- str_replace(df$series_title," in U.S. city average, all urban consumers, seasonally adjusted","")

head(df[,c("series_id","short_name")])

```

dA$Date <- as.Date(paste0(dA$year,"-",substr(dA$period,2,3),"-01"),format = "%Y-%m-%d")

dA <- dA[grepl("CUS",dA$series_id),]

dA <- dA %>%   arrange(series_id,Date) %>%

  )
