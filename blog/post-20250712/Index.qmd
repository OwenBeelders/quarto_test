# Introduction

I have struggled to blog regularly. As a consequence, I run into technology issues. On July 10th I wrote a blog and used the "Environment, Histor, .." pane to commit my changes to git hub, but I received the following error

I shelved the decision to commit and waited until Saturday morning to learn more about gpg. I found the github pages to set up the key etc. and then I turned to RStudio to figure out how to add the key.  A google search lead me to the fact that RStudio is set  up for ssh and not gpg. I then set up a new ssh key within RStudio using the Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN > Create SSH Key steps.

What I also remembered is that when I watched a video on setting up quarto for blogging, commits were done via the terminal window.  So what worked for me is the following two lines at the command line: 

git commit "commit message"

git push origin main

where you specify the relevant "commit message".

It's actually quite simple if you know what you are doing, and waste countless hours if you don't.
