## Census Bureau

The landing page for trade data is <https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/index.html>. A good starting point for learning how to use the API is the pdf [International Trade Data API User Guide](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/reference/guides/Guide_to_International_Trade_Datasets.pdf)

You only need a Census Bureau [API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) if you will submit more than 500 API calls a day.

There are five components to each API query:

-   level 0: the base URL \<"http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/intltrade/"\>
-   level 1: The choice of imports or exports
-   level 2: the endpoint (commodity classification)
-   level 3: the variables to download
-   level 4: the clauses of the query

The nine [endpoints](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/guide/sec2.html#classification) are listed below along with their abbreviation for use in the query:

-   hs: [harmonized system](https://www.trade.gov/harmonized-system-hs-codes)
-   statehs: harmonized system by state
-   porths: harmonized system by port
-   naics: North American Industry Classification System ([NAICS](https://www.census.gov/naics/) )
-   enduse: the end-use classification system that is used for the [monthly FT900 trade report](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/ft900%20index.html)
-   sitc: Standard International Trade Classification System [SITC](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/reference/codes/sitc/sitcmstr.txt)
-   hitech: [Advanced Technology](https://www.census.gov/foreign-%20trade/guide/sec2.html#classification)
-   usda: U.S. Department of Agriculture

Appendixes A and B of the [pdf](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/reference/guides/Guide_to_International_Trade_Datasets.pdf) list the variables that can be downloaded for exports and imports, respectively. However, there are some differences in the available variables for exports and imports so it is better to use the list of variables that is associated with each endpoint. The urls have the following format

https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/intltrade/\[exports/imports\]/\[endpoint\]/variables.html

For example, if you are downloading **export** data from the **hs** endpoint the url is

<https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/intltrade/exports/hs/variables.html>

and if you are downloading **import** data from the **enduse** endpoint the url is

<https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/intltrade/imports/enduse/variables.html>

The key variables can be categorized as follows and are separated by a comma in the api call.

-   commodity code, commodity short and long description
-   monthly and year-to-date value of exports/imports
-   monthly and year-to-date quantity of exports/imports
-   country name and country code of origin or destination
-   shipping type, e.g. air, container, etc.
-   port and district of origin or destination

The clauses of the query usually involve the selection of a date, time series, country, port, state or product type.

-   specific year and month: time=2013-03 or YEAR=2013&MONTH=03
-   time series: time=from+2013-01+to+2013-11
-   country name: CTY NAME = Mexico
-   country code: CTY CODE=2010 (2010 is the country code for Mexico)
-   product type: I_COMMODITY=9504500000 is the clause for selecting imports of video games

The clauses of the query are separated by an ampersand, i.e. the query for imported video games from mexico for March 2013 would like:

YEAR=2013&MONTH=03&CTY\_ NAME=MEXICO&I_COMMODITY=9504500000

Note

-   country codes can be obtained from the **Geographic Code** section of the [reference](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/reference/index.html) page.
-   the most comprehensive page for product codes is the **concordance** of the [reference](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/reference/index.html) page. The concordance contains each product type and is listed for all of the endpoints.
-   Take note that you should select the concordance for the appropriate **year** AND that **imports** and **exports** each have their own concordance.
-   There is a separate file that lists the [structure](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/schedules/b/2025/exp-stru.txt) of the concordance
- there is an html page [schedule B 2025](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/schedules/b/2025/index.html) that provides more information about all of the schedule B goods. 

It is easiest to demonstrate the structure of the api with actual api calls.

## Simple API calls

The [pdf](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/reference/guides/Guide%20to%20International%20Trade%20Datasets.pdf) lists sample calls on pages 14 and 15. These can be cut-and-pasted into a browser.

In R it is easy to use the package [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html) to implement the api call and the package [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) to extract the data.

On May 4 2025, in Apollo's [The Daily Spark](https://www.apolloacademy.com/will-there-be-fireworks-on-the-4th-of-july/), it was noted that 97% of baby carriages were imported from China. Can we verify this? Here is a list of the level information required to do so:

-   level 1: imports
-   level 2: harmonized system - we want a specific commodity so we use a granular index
-   level 3: commodity name, dollar amount imported, we can find the variable names permitted at the url <https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/intltrade/imports/hs/variables.html>\>
-   level 4: query for baby carriage imports from all countries in 2024 the most recent complete year where the hs code for baby carriages is 8715000020.

We convert this to a API call as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE

library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

l0 <- "https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/intltrade/"
l1 <- "imports"
l2 <- "hs"
l3 <- "I_COMMODITY_SDESC,GEN_VAL_YR,CTY_CODE,CTY_NAME"
l4 <- "YEAR=2024&MONTH=12&I_COMMODITY=8715000020"

api_call <- paste0(l0,l1,"/",l2,"?get=",l3,"&",l4)

res <- GET(api_call)

predf <- fromJSON(rawToChar(res$content) )

df <- as.data.frame(predf[2:nrow(predf),])
names(df) <- predf[1,]

df$GEN_VAL_YR <- as.numeric(df$GEN_VAL_YR)

View(df)
```

Comments about the R code:

-   I_COMMODITY is the variable name for the commodity code
-   I_COMMODITY_SDESC is the variable name for the short description of the commodity
-   GEN VAL YR is the variable name for Year-to-Date General Imports, Total Value
-   GEN_VAL_YR is read in as a character so has to be converted to numeric

<https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/intltrade/imports/hs?get=I_COMMODITY_SDESC,GEN_VAL_YR,CTY_CODE,CTY_NAME&YEAR=2024&MONTH=12&I_COMMODITY=8715000020>

![Data sorted in descending order of GEN_VAL_YR](baby_carriage_view.png)

Total imports from all countries in 2024 was \$358,702,390 and the imports from China was \$348,697,326 which is 97.21%

## Misc

The [international trade API Query Builder tool](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/api_tool.html) highlights the key inputs for a query.
